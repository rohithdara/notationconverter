# notationconverter
This program uses stacks to convert between prefix, infix, and postfix notation. It can also solve postfix notation problems. Make sure to have the stack_array file downloaded as well -- it contains the Python version of the stack data structure necessary.

To run this program, add the desired conversion or calculation into the exp_eval.py file and use:
```
python3 exp_eval.py
```
If you don't have version 3 of python, you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
